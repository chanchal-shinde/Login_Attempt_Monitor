# Login_Attempt_Monitor
A Python-based security log analysis tool that monitors login attempts, counts failed logins per user, detects suspicious behavior using threshold-based rules, and generates a human-readable security repo

Project Overview :-

The project focuses on security thinking, system log analysis, and decision-based detection, rather than UI or web features.

Reads and parses login attempt log files.

Differentiates between successful and failed login attempts.

Tracks failed login attempts per user.

Detects suspicious users using a configurable threshold.

Generates a clean, human-readable security report .
